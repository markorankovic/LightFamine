Game where you avoid the dark areas

This project is on a 3D game in which the player must avoid touching all dark surfaces, there should be light surfaces players can move through in order to reach the goal of the level. Currently it is uncertain exactly as to what this game will entail, so anybody reading at some point this, all I can say for now is stay tuned and hopefully I will be able to introduce features into this game that will be worth people's time!
