## About
This macOS game is an ongoing project which features a moveable cylinder which the player moves toward a goal of the level. Between the player and the goal is a dark area which takes the player back to the start when entering. The player should hence stay in the light unless on top of objects to avoid touching the dark floor surface.

## Controls
F, G, H, T      ->     Move left, down, right and up

Space           ->     Jump

LMB and drag    ->     Rotate the camera

Pinch           ->     Zoom in and vice versa to zoom out

### There currently are only five levels, but given the circumstances many more are expected to come, so stay tuned!
